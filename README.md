## Baseline Implementation and Treatment Effect Estimators:
The valuable contributions of the broader community in advancing open-source AI is acknowledge. The folders 'bmdal_reg' and 'causal_bald' serve as baselines (e.g., LCMD, Causal-BALD) and shared estimators (e.g., DUE-DNN), referencing existing literature as follows:
